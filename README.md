# LoginAsDiscordBot
This open source program allows you to login to Discord as a Discord bot. Please note logging in as a Discord bot is against ToS. Please use with caution.

This program does not store any tokens or personal information. To decrease your chance of your Discord bot being hacked, please reset your token after each session.

# Scraping server data
You can now scrape simple server data like channels, categories, news (announcement) channels, server names, and others.
These features are still in development though.
- Managed to basically abuse the Discord API to use different version URLs to provide no cooldown: /api/v8 /api/v9 /api/v10 and others

## WIP
This software is a work in progress. Please try and come back later.
